# My-first-Portfolio
In this project I created my first site using Html and CSS with 0 starter code. While creating my portfolio I demonstrated my ability to properly use Html elements and write the code with proper syntax, as well as my ability to use classes pseudo-classes,:hover, and media queries. 

You can see in this project it fits the acceptance criteria set in the project guidelines, but also has my own creative take on the design of my portfolio pages, I got these results from a few hours of tinkering with the css using elements we haven't discussed yet in class to give some of the aesthetic elements of my site, the header and footer make a gradient blending into the white of the page but the elements are both present in my Html and css.
